Globally, the issue of income inequality has a profound impact on all aspects of society, and its importance cannot be ignored, especially when exploring individual well-being. Studying the correlation between inequality and happiness (subjective well-being) can help policymakers understand the extent to which unequal distribution of wealth affects overall life satisfaction in society. If a correlation is found, it can signal the need for policies aimed at reducing inequality. We want to shed light on the broader societal and psychological effects of economic disparities. So, in this study, we aim to answer: Is there a generalized correlation between income inequality and happiness in countries across the globe?
